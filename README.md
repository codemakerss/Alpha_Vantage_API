# Financial Data Encapsulation

I am using Alpha Vantage API to get financial data and reporting as Excel workbooks as well as

inserting those data to my local MySQL database and database maintenance.

Three parts of file: API data, Inserting database, Database maintenance 

## API data

Get daily, weekly, monthly, intraday stock price data from Alpha Vantage.

listing and delsting status, company information are also provided.

## Inserting database

Make sure MySQL has already been installed on your computer.

Select the user with your password to create your own financial database.

## Database maintenance

Database backup before checking each table in your database.

The historical error data will be deleted and fixed value will be uodated.
